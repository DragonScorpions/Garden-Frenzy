Garden Frenzy is a clicker game. A player begins the game with just enough money to buy a few seeds to plant crops, eventually making enough to buy more seeds and plant more crops, and so on. The goal is to make as much money as possible in five minutes.

## How To Play

Click "Start" on the Main Menu to begin a new game. If an unfinished game has been saved, you may also click "Continue" to load a saved game.

You start the game with a balance shown at the bottom left. The balance may be used to buy seeds and plots, which will earn you more money. The objective is to gain as much money as possible before 5 minutes has elapsed.

To plant a seed, click any of the available seeds at the bottom right. Only one may be selected at a time. Next, click an empty plot tile to plant the seed in that plot. At this instant, the seed is purchased using your balance, and the plant begins to grow. Each plant has growth stages, and it may only be harvested in its ripe state. If you attempt to harvest too early or too late, you will not collect money from that crop.

To harvest, select the harvesting tool to the left of the seed store. You may then click a tile and attempt to harvest.

To purchase a new plot (to increase growing capacity), ensure your balance exceeds the "Plot Cost" shown at the bottom-left of the screen. Then, click a locked plot to unlock and purchase that plot.

At any point, you may click "Save" to save your status and pause the game for later.
